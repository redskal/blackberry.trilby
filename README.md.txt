###### _Proof of Concept worm for Blackberry devices circa 2007_

Originally coded way back in 2007. My first and last experience with using
Java. Once was enough!

I never actually found a means of testing this worm. Back then RIM wanted
dev's to buy cert's to sign their apps without any other options for testing.
Their JDE was absolute trash - nothing ever worked in it; I ended up developing
with NetBeans (which made imports behave very strange). The simulator RIM
shipped was also a complete waste of time and no matter what I tried it failed
constantly.

Later on RIM started giving out free developer cert's. By that stage I had no
interest in working on this worm. Blackberry had fallen out of favour and it
seemed a little pointless for me to chase old tech.

So I'm publishing it in its current state - not tested, not debugged, and
unloved!
